<hr>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Accusers: The primary accusers were Meletus, Anytus, and Lycon. Meletus specifically brought the charges of impiety and corrupting the youth, while Anytus and Lycon had political motivations related to Socratesâ€™ associations with individuals who were seen as hostile to the democracy of Athens.
Defense: Socrates defended himself in a speech that was recorded by his student Plato in works like the Apology. In his defense, Socrates argued that he was not intentionally corrupting the youth and that he was, in fact, fulfilling a divine mission by encouraging people to seek truth and virtue. He claimed that he believed in gods, but his interpretation of them might differ from conventional religious views. He also argued that he had never sought personal gain from his teachings.</p>
